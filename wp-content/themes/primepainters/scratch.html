                            likely will bring up your home’s value, too!

                <p class="content">My husband found Prime Painters LLC on Kudzu along with a few other companies after we had a leak in our kitchen from our master bath and decided to get them repainted. When we met Emil, we could tell he was serious about his work and
                his company would do a great job. We thought his estimate was fair, and we are impressed with his work. Emil is very detailed and made sure the job was done right. We will definitely use Prime Painters again for our painting needs.

                We have had many neighbors come to compliment the job and ask for the painters' information. We used Prime Painters years ago in a previous home for inside painting and were just as pleased with both jobs done!
